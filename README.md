# Delta (Python Port)

Python port of the javascript Delta library for QuillJS: https://github.com/quilljs/delta

Some basic pythonizing has been done, but mostly it works exactly like the above library.

There is no other python specific documentation at this time, sorry.  Please see the tests
for reference examples.
